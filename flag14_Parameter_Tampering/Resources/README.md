# Parameter Tampering - Survey

## Why is it dangerous ?

Each time a client is sending information to the server, the server has to check it. Never trust what's the client is sending. Because if it is modifying a field, like we did, then he could send SQL or XSS injection, for example. The data client-side are controllable by the client itself.
Imagine a e-commerce online shop that doesn't verify on the server-side what data the client is sending. Then the client could modify the prices, create big discounts, ...
