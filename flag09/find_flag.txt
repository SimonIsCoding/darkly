This is XSS. Before, in the message input, we tried <script>alert("whatever")</script> to see how it behaved. By writting <script>, we saw that it erased it as if it was not there, to avoid XSS, but not 'script' itself. So if we find a way to create a script without writing exactly <script>, then it is XSS hackable.
