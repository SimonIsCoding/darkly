10 - Upload it into the darkly website in the Burp Suite default web browser. Click on 'Upload' button 
11 - Go back to Burp Suite. In the 'Proxy' panel, you have a 'Request' window. Inside of this window, you will change: 'Content-Type: application/octet-stream' into 'Content-Type: image/jpg'
12 - Press 'forward' button.
13 - Go back to the Burp Suite default web browser. Do not touch anything, just let it load the new page.
