How to find this flag ?

1 - Open the developer tools in web browser with CTRL + SHIFT + I
2 - Go to the 'Storage' section
3 - On the left sidebar, open the 'cookies' section
4 - Click on 'http://yourIPaddress'
5 - On the item tabs, there is 'Name' and 'Value' row
	You can see that 'Name' row has 'I_am_admin' as name -> meaning it might be the name of the admin
6 - Recover the content of 'Value' cell. This is a hash string, encrypted with MD5 algorithm. Once you decrypt it, you will see that the content is 'false'
7 - Then, replace this encrypted content by the hashed string 'true' with the same MD5 encryption method. It should give you: 'b326b5062b2f0e69046810717534cb09'
8 - Paste 'b326b5062b2f0e69046810717534cb09' into the value cell. 
9 - Reload the page. It should give you an alert popup with the new flag. Well done: you found it!
