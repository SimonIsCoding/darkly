How to find the flag ? 

Let's do basically the same as Flag04 but for Search Member by ID section
1 - In the homepage, click on Member button located in the header
	-> By searching: 1, then 2, then ... until 5 -> you get an indication that the flag can be hidden in the number 5 member ID
2 - In the input box, write '5 union select user(), database()', then press submit button. By doing this you want to get the info of the database, to know how it is structured
	-> it can be potentially SQL injected. Let's dive deeper to know it
Then you can also see that the Surname is 'Member_Sql_Injection' for member ID 5. This will help us for the future.
3 - In the input box, write '5 union select table_name, table_schema FROM information_schema.tables'
	-> WHY this input ? This is written in the PHP manual
	-> It will give all the information about how are structured the tables in the database -> look for 'Member_Sql_Injection' section
	-> It gives you another information which is the First Name called 'users'
4 - Now we want to know how is specific users table is structured:
	-> In the input box, write '5 union select COLUMN_NAME, table_name FROM information_schema.columns'
	-> It will give you how every COLUMN_NAME are structured 
	-> Find the users one, because this is the one that interests us
	You can see that it is divided in 8 parts: user_id, first_name, last_name, town, country, planet, Commentaire, countersign
5 - Then try to look for the information for each component of users. For example, in the input box, write '5 union select countersign, Commentaire FROM users' -> then read all the info and you should get the flag
	-> the flag is '10a16d834f9b1e4068b25c4c46fe0284e99e44dceaf08098fc83925ba6310ff5'
