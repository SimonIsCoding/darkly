How to prevent it ? 

- Never trust what the client is sending
- Never store sensitive data on the client-side

Why it is dangerous ? 

Each time a client is sending information to the server, the server has to check it. Never trust what's the client is sending. Because if it is modifying a field, like we did, then he could send SQL or XSS injection, for example. The data client-side are controllable by the client itself.
