Why is it dangerous ? 

The path listed in robots.txt are pointing directly to the attacker's targets. In this example, we can easily download htpasswd file and then connect as a root/admin. This is the most critical vulnerability because once you are admin you can do whatever you want. For example, change other user passwords, modify datas, deplay backdoors, download all sensitive data,...
Secondly, it is important to not display admin panel page in the webroot. Attackers could brute force it in order to access to the admin account.

How to prevent it ?
- Never expose configuration file or identification file in the webroot
- Deactivate repertory listing
- Don't use robots.txt to hide sensitive informations
