Why is it dangerous ?

The path listed in robots.txt are pointing directly to what the attacker wants. In this example, we can easily download htpasswd file and then connect as a root/admin. The impact is critical because if the attacker succeed to be admin you can do whatever you want. For example, change other user passwords, modify datas, deplay backdoors, download all sensitive data,...
Secondly, it is important to not display admin panel page in the webroot. Attackers could brute force it in order to access to the admin account.

How to prevent it ?
- Never expose configuration file or identification file in the webroot
- Deactivate repertory listing
- Don't put sensitive information on path shown in robots.txt file
